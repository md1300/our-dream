<p>Graphic design is the art of communication through layout, photos, color, and typography. Graphic designers craft authentic narratives with visuals so viewers can easily read and enjoy different digital and print content. 

    This art form also exists at the convergence of business and creativity. Traditionally, we tend to think of graphic design as a purely creative field consisting of artists and those who can draw. Although creativity is a big part of graphic design, strategic business thinking is just as valuable, as graphic design serves as a crucial function in crafting marketing messages for businesses. 
    
    So many aspects of the modern environment — the movie poster you walk by, the mail in your mailbox, the website you visit, the email you receive — are created by someone who understands and practices the art of graphic design. For the companies who commission these design projects, graphic design is a gateway to new clients, new viewers, and most importantly, more money.
